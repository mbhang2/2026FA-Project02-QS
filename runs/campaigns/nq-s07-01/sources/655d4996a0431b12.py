"""Opening-range breakout with delta confirmation and opening-auction sign.

The campaign asks whether a move out of the regular-hours opening range holds or
the range wins.  The best prior strategy (#11) bought the first 5-minute close
above the 30-minute RTH opening range whose signed order flow (`bar.delta`)
agreed with the break, sold the mirror image, and protected the trade with a
symmetric half-range bracket.  It scored +0.0438.

This proposal keeps that entry signal and the symmetric half-range bracket
exactly as in #11, but adds one piece of information from the opening range
itself: the sign of the auction's cumulative signed order flow over the range.
A long breakout is taken only when the opening range's cumulative delta is
non-negative, and a short breakout only when it is non-positive.  The economic
claim is that a break in the same direction as the opening auction's order flow
is more likely to hold, while a break against that flow is more likely to be
absorbed and returned inside the range.

Opening range:
    High and low of the first 30 minutes of regular-hours trading
    (`08:30 CT` to `09:00 CT`), measured on 5-minute bars.  The RTH open is
    15.5 hours after the CME Globex session open (`17:00 CT`); with bars
    anchored to the session open this is a fixed bar offset and involves no
    lookahead.

Signal:
    After the range is known, the first completed 5-minute bar that closes
    above the range high with `bar.delta > 0` is bought, provided the
    opening-range cumulative delta is >= 0.  The first completed bar that
    closes below the range low with `bar.delta < 0` is sold, provided the
    opening-range cumulative delta is <= 0.  One trade per session.

Exit:
    Entry is protected immediately by the engine's bracket, with stop and
    target offsets both equal to half the opening-range height.  Any open
    position is flattened by `15:00 CT` or earlier on short sessions, because
    the engine does not flatten positions automatically.
