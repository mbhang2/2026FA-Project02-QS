"""This proposal was blocked. It is a trial and it counts toward N.

reason:  call_failed
detail:  no python block in a 4503-character reply

No strategy was produced, so there is nothing to run. The file raises at module
level on purpose: the run then fails to load, `run.py` records `outcome:
crashed` with this message, and the trial keeps its row in the ledger. The
alternative -- returning nothing and skipping the trial -- would shrink N by
exactly the proposals that failed, which is the cheapest way to cheat a
multiple-testing correction and the one nobody would look for.
