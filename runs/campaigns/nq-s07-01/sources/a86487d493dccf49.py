"""Opening-range breakout: follow strong-close breaks, fade extreme weak closes.

Best prior strategy #41 follows strong-close, delta-confirmed opening-range
breakouts and fades weak-close, delta-confirmed breakouts.  It scored +0.1970.

This proposal keeps #41's opening-range construction, 10% buffer, 5-minute
bars, close-strength split at 0.6, half-range bracket, 15:00 CT flatten and
14:30 CT entry cutoff exactly.  The single change is on the fade side: a fade
is now taken only when the breakout bar closes in the opposite extreme 40% of
its body (`close_location <= 0.40` for an up break, `>= 0.60` for a down
break).  #41 fades any non-strong close, including bars that close mid-body.

The thesis is that a mid-body close after a breakout is ambiguous: the bar
neither confirms the move nor clearly rejects it.  The "range wins" account is
specifically about a breakout bar that has already retraced to the opposite end
of its range, not one that merely closed in the middle.  Restricting fades to
the unambiguous reversal bars should keep the profitable fades while removing
noise.  The "move holds" side is unchanged.

Opening range:
    High and low of the first 30 minutes of regular-hours trading
    (`08:30 CT` to `09:00 CT`), measured on 5-minute bars.  The RTH open is
    15.5 hours after the CME Globex session open (`17:00 CT`); with bars
    anchored to the session open this is a fixed bar offset and involves no
    lookahead.

Signal:
    After the range is known, look at the first completed 5-minute bar whose
    close is outside the range by at least `breakout_buffer_mult` times the
    range height and whose signed order flow confirms the direction of the
    break (`bar.delta > 0` above the range, `bar.delta < 0` below it).

    For a bar above the range:
      * if its close is in the top `close_strength` fraction of its own body,
        buy the breakout (the move holds);
      * if its close is in the bottom `(1 - close_strength)` fraction, sell
        (the range wins).
      * otherwise the bar is ambiguous and no trade is taken.
    For a bar below the range:
      * if its close is in the bottom `(1 - close_strength)` fraction, sell
        the breakdown;
      * if its close is in the top `close_strength` fraction, buy.
      * otherwise the bar is ambiguous and no trade is taken.

    One trade per session.

Exit:
    Entry is protected immediately by the engine's bracket, with stop and
    target offsets both equal to half the opening-range height.  Any open
    position is flattened by `15:00 CT` or earlier on short sessions, because
    the engine does not flatten positions automatically.
